I'm fairly certain everything was implemented correctly (with regard to JSON; I haven't done the CSS yet).

I didn't collaborate with anyone.

I spent 30-45 minutes on the JSON parsing and output. CSS will probably take way longer than that.

Honestly, I have no idea where that "i" came from in the jobs.html commit message. I didn't type it.
