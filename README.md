This repository contains most of the work I did for COMP 20 (Web Programming) in the Spring 2014 semester.

My favorite project was the MBTA transit project. It is also the project I am most proud of because I did a lot of the work before Ming talked about how to do it in class. I got to be creative and explore a lot of parts of the Google Maps API.

I think I've grown a lot since January. Most of my previous experience was playing with Codecademy over the previous winter break (and COMP 11, but that was 2 years ago), and I've definitely learned a lot more since then.
