COMP 20 Assignment 3
14 March 2014

-3/5: I've spent about 2 or 3 hours on this, at least an hour and a half
 on getting the Google Maps API to work.
-3/7: Spent about an hour adding station data, setting up the info window,
 and using the xhr request. So far, it works.
-3/8: I spent roughly 2 hours on adding station markers and playing connect the dots.
-3/9: 2 hours on info windows and Haversine formula
-3/10: 0.5 hours on mostly aesthetics
-3/13: 2.5 hours

Sometime between Monday and Thursday, the keys for Lat and Lng in Google Maps
objects must have changed (used to be 'd' and 'e', are now 'k' and 'A' as of 3/13).
If finding the nearest station does not work when you grade it, that's probably why.
--Error would be where haversine() is called in findNearest()

Did not work in Firefox (used Chrome)
