COMP 20 Assignment 3
14 March 2014

As of 3/5: I've spent about 2 or 3 hours on this, at least an hour and a half on getting the Google Maps API to work.
3/7: Spent about an hour adding station data, setting up the info window, and using the xhr request. So far, it works.
3/8: I spent roughly 2 hours on adding station markers and polylines.

NOTES:
--I used http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm to convert the CSV station data to JSON. I spent an hour or two working with that on 3/6, but during that time, my repo became corrupt and I lost that.
--Times my repo has been corrupt and needed to be recloned: 2
