As of 3/5: I've spent about 2 or 3 hours on this, at least an hour and a half on getting the Google Maps API to work.

NOTES:
--While testing in the EPDC, geolocation puts me literally in the middle of Somerville. Not sure if that's a computer issue because Chrome on my iPhone crashed before it could get to that point (twice).
