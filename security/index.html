	<h1>Security Report for 2048 Gamecenter</h2>
	<h2>Why I'm not doing it</h2>
	<p>by Sarah Ruckhaus</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Dear Ming,</p>
	<p>I have made the decision not to do Assignment 5. I am taking this class pass/fail and decided my time would be better spent learning how to use things necessary for the group project since they're all getting grades in this course, and I'd hate to let them down.</p>
	<p>James Collins, whose Gamecenter I was assigned to hack, is aware of my decision.</p>
	<p>Best,<br />Sarah Ruckhaus</p>
